- like previous exploit we need to override m value to fulfil the if condition

- so we have to write 16930116 bytes with printf and access m address stored at
the beginning of str by using $ flag
- we then have to write into m using n specifier

- printf param (str address) is 24 octets far from ebp, 32 (24 + 8) bytes
from p argument
- p argument is 16 bytes under str, so 1st printf param is 48 (32 + 16) or (4 * 12)
bytes from str. That means we can access the m address stored at the begining of
str using 12$
- after finding m address (0x08049810) using gdb, we can create our exploit command
	- ruby -e 'print "\x10\x98\x04\x08" + "%16930112x" + "%12$n"' | ./level4
